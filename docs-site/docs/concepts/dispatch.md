# Dispatch

The dispatch layer turns a natural-language intent into at most one tool
call. In 1.0 it has two halves that can be used separately:

- **Resolution** (`runtime.resolve(intent)`) chooses a tool, or refuses to,
  and explains why. It never executes anything.
- **Execution** (`runtime.dispatchById(toolId, args)`) runs exactly one
  named tool after validating its arguments.

`runtime.dispatch(intent, args)` does both, and runs a tool only when the
dispatch policy allows it. This page describes `@smallchat/core` 1.0
(TypeScript); smallchat-swift 1.0 follows the same outcomes and runs the
same conformance vectors (`spec/resolve/`).

## Resolution

```typescript
const r = await runtime.resolve('search for code', { args });
switch (r.outcome) {
  case 'resolved':             // r.chosen is the tool id; r.tier its confidence tier
    await runtime.dispatchById(r.chosen!, args, { resolutionDigest: r.proof.proofDigest });
    break;
  case 'needs-disambiguation': // candidates exist but none may run on its own
  case 'unresolved':           // nothing plausible matched
    console.log(r.reason, r.candidates.map(c => c.toolId), r.refinement?.options);
    break;
  case 'throttled':            // opt-in rate limiter; retry after r.retryAfterMs
    break;
}
```

The resolution flow, in order:

```
resolve(intent)
  │
  ├─ 1. Pinned phrase?        the intent is, verbatim, an exact pin's phrase → that tool
  ├─ 2. Learned exact intent? the user chose a tool for this intent text before → that tool
  ├─ 3. Cache                 an earlier HIGH/EXACT resolution of this intent text (no-arg calls)
  ├─ 4. Rate limit (opt-in)   per principal, before a novel intent is embedded
  ├─ 5. Embed the intent      its own vector; intents are never interned
  ├─ 6. Vector search         tool selectors ≥ LOW (MEDIUM in strict mode), quantized,
  │                           ties broken by tool id; overloads chosen by argument types
  ├─ 7. Learned similar       a bounded boost toward a tool chosen for a similar intent
  ├─ 8. Protocols             only when nothing matched by vector
  ├─ 9. Pin gate              a pinned tool is excluded for intents its pin refuses
  ├─ 10. Nothing left?        unresolved (refinement options; decomposition when dispatching)
  ├─ 11. Verification         below HIGH (below EXACT in strict mode), every candidate gets
  │                           the same checks; an LLM verifier's approval is required by default
  └─ 12. Dispatch policy      the same rules on every path (see below)
```

Every step is recorded in `r.proof` (candidates with scores and tiers,
exclusions, guards, thresholds, the embedder fingerprint, the artifact hash)
with a stable `proofDigest`. `runtime.explain(intent)` and
`smallchat explain` print it.

## The dispatch policy

One rule set (`evaluateDispatchPolicy`) decides whether a chosen tool may run
without the caller naming it:

1. Dispatch by exact tool id is always allowed.
2. Intent pins: an `exact` pin admits only its phrases; an `elevated` pin
   admits only a similarity, measured from the intent's own embedding, at or
   above its threshold. A pin covers every tool its selector reaches
   (overload variants and every class declaring it).
3. Destructive tools (MCP `destructiveHint: true`, or `readOnlyHint: false`
   without a `destructiveHint`) run only by exact id, a pinned phrase or
   EXACT similarity — never from the cache or a learned preference.
4. Below HIGH, a tool runs only with an LLM verifier's approval
   (`requireLLMForSubHighDispatch`, on by default).
5. Below LOW, nothing runs.

A path the policy refuses does not fall back to another way of running the
tool: the outcome is `needs-disambiguation`, and the caller chooses a tool by
id. There is no fallback chain and no "broadened" search that executes a
weaker match.

## Execution

`dispatchById(toolId, args)` looks the tool up by its canonical id (O(1), no
embedding), validates the arguments against its `inputSchema` (JSON Schema
2020-12 by default), computes the canonical call digest, appends to the
decision log if one is configured, and only then runs it.

```typescript
const result = await runtime.dispatchById('github/search_code', { query: 'generics' });
// result.metadata.proof.ran === 'github/search_code'; result.metadata.proof.callDigest
```

## Results that ran nothing

`dispatch()` and `dispatchById()` never throw for a call that did not run.
They return `isError: true` with `metadata.outcome`:

| `metadata.outcome` | ran a tool? |
|---|---|
| `resolved` | yes (the tool's own failure is `isError: true` with this outcome) |
| `needs-disambiguation` | no — `content.candidates` / `refinement.options` carry tool ids |
| `unresolved` | no — nothing matched (or an unknown tool id) |
| `throttled` | no — see `metadata.retryAfterMs` |
| `invalid-arguments` | no — `metadata.validationErrors` |
| `aborted` | no — the signal fired before the tool started |

The fluent `execContent()` throws `DispatchError` (with `outcome`,
`candidates` and `result`) for any of these instead of returning the error
payload as content.

## Streaming

```typescript
for await (const event of runtime.dispatchStream('summarize this file', { path: './README.md' })) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'resolving':       console.log('Resolving:', event.intent); break;
    case 'tool-start':      console.log('Tool:', event.toolId, event.confidence); break;
    case 'chunk':           console.log(event.content); break;
    case 'inference-delta': process.stdout.write(event.delta.text); break;
    case 'done':            console.log(event.result.isError ? event.result.metadata?.outcome : 'Done.'); break;
    case 'error':           console.error(event.error); break;
  }
}
```

Streaming uses the same resolution and policy. An intent that runs nothing
goes from `resolving` straight to `done` with an `isError` result.
`dispatchStreamById(toolId, args)` streams a call by exact id.

## Refinement

When resolution does not choose a tool, `r.refinement.options` lists the
candidates (each with a `toolId`). After the user picks one,
`runtime.resolveRefinement(intent, option, args)` runs it by id and teaches
the semantic map, so the same intent text resolves to that tool next time
(a learned preference never authorizes a pinned or destructive tool).

## `DispatchContext`

`ToolRuntime` owns one `DispatchContext` (`runtime.context`): the selector
table, resolution cache, registered tool classes and their index by tool id,
intent pins, the observer and semantic map, the LLM client and the policy
options. The lower-level functions `resolveIntent(context, intent)`,
`dispatchById(context, toolId, args)`, `toolkit_dispatch(context, intent,
args)` and `smallchat_dispatchStream(context, intent, args)` take it as their
first argument; the `ToolRuntime` methods are thin wrappers over them.
