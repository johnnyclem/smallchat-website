# LoomMCP

[LoomMCP](https://muhnehh.github.io/loom-mcp/) is an MCP server that turns a codebase into a queryable symbol graph. Instead of paying tokens to re-read whole files, an agent calls one of LoomMCP's 17 tools — `loom_get_topology`, `loom_focus`, `loom_search_refs`, and friends — and gets back exactly the function, class, or reference set it asked for. The project reports an average **97% reduction in tokens** spent reading code.

LoomMCP and smallchat solve adjacent problems:

| Layer | Problem | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| **Retrieval** | "Don't read whole files; fetch the right symbols." | LoomMCP |
| **Dispatch** | "Don't dump 17 tool schemas in the prompt; route the intent." | smallchat |

Wire them together and the agent stops paying twice — once for tool selection, once for source code.

## Why combine them

LoomMCP exposes 17 MCP tools. Surfacing all of them through Claude Code or any MCP client puts every schema in the model's context on every turn — exactly the failure mode smallchat was built to fix. Compile LoomMCP through smallchat and the agent expresses intent ("find every caller of `loginUser`") without ever seeing the tool list. smallchat resolves the intent to `loom_search_refs` semantically and dispatches.

## Install LoomMCP

```bash
npm install -g @loom-mcp/server
```

LoomMCP exposes a live observability dashboard at `http://localhost:2337` once the server is running.

## Compile LoomMCP through smallchat

LoomMCP advertises its tools over the standard MCP `tools/list` endpoint, so smallchat can introspect it directly. Point the compiler at a config that launches LoomMCP as an MCP subprocess:

```json title="loom.mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loom": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@loom-mcp/server"],
      "env": {
        "LOOM_PROJECT_ROOT": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then compile:

```bash
npx -y @smallchat/core@^1 compile --source ./loom.mcp.json --output loom.toolkit.json
```

The compiler starts LoomMCP, reads its `tools/list`, and writes `loom.toolkit.json`. The output lists the artifact's format, content hash and tool and provider counts, saves the discovered manifests, and writes a header file.

## Verify dispatch resolution

Before wiring it into an agent, sanity-check that natural-language intents land on the right LoomMCP tool:

```bash
npx -y @smallchat/core@^1 resolve loom.toolkit.json "show me the file layout of src"
# expect Chosen: loom/loom_get_topology

npx -y @smallchat/core@^1 resolve loom.toolkit.json "page in the loginUser function"
# expect Chosen: loom/loom_focus

npx -y @smallchat/core@^1 resolve loom.toolkit.json "where is loginUser called from?"
# expect Chosen: loom/loom_search_refs
```

Each command prints the outcome, the tier, the candidate table and the proof digest. Nothing runs. Below HIGH tier, smallchat 1.0.0 runs a tool only when an LLM verifier approves it (`requireLLMForSubHighDispatch`, on by default); without one the outcome is `needs-disambiguation` and the candidates come back to call by id. That matters when two LoomMCP tools sit close to each other in semantic space (for example `loom_focus` vs. `loom_get_definition`).

## Use it in code

```typescript
import { loadRuntime } from '@smallchat/core';

// The artifact records LoomMCP's launch spec; its tools run on that server.
const { runtime, upstreams } = await loadRuntime('./loom.toolkit.json');

// Three-step LoomMCP workflow expressed as natural-language intents
const topology = await runtime.dispatch('scan the src directory', {
  path: 'src/',
});

const symbol = await runtime.dispatch('focus on the loginUser function', {
  symbol: 'src/auth.ts::loginUser',
});

const refs = await runtime.dispatch('find every caller of loginUser', {
  symbol: 'loginUser',
});

// A result that ran nothing is isError with metadata.outcome
// ('needs-disambiguation', 'unresolved', ...) and the candidates' tool ids.
for (const r of [topology, symbol, refs]) {
  if (r.isError) console.log(r.metadata?.outcome, r.content);
}

await upstreams.close();
```

The agent never sees `loom_get_topology`, `loom_focus`, or `loom_search_refs` in its context — smallchat resolves each intent to a LoomMCP tool and forwards the call when the dispatch policy allows it; below HIGH confidence (without an LLM verifier) it returns the candidates instead, and the agent calls the one it means by id (`runtime.dispatchById('loom/loom_focus', args)`).

## Serve as a single MCP endpoint

To serve the compiled toolkit as one MCP server that forwards each call to LoomMCP, run:

```bash
npx -y @smallchat/core@^1 serve --source loom.toolkit.json
```

Configure your MCP client to launch that command over stdio, or add `--http` and point it at `http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp` with the bearer token from `~/.smallchat/serve-token`. The client sees LoomMCP's tools as `loom__loom_focus`, `loom__loom_search_refs` and so on, each with its upstream schema, plus `smallchat_resolve`, which proposes a tool for a plain-language intent without running it. To keep LoomMCP's own tool names, add `--provider loom`. The artifact records `LOOM_PROJECT_ROOT` by name only, so `serve` passes it on from its own environment: set it there.
