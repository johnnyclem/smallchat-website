# Why it matters

## The problem: tool proliferation

Modern AI applications integrate with dozens of tools — search, databases, filesystems, APIs, internal services. As tool counts grow, routing becomes the bottleneck. The naive approaches all break at scale:

**String matching** — `if (intent.includes("search")) callSearchTool()`. Brittle. Misses paraphrases. Fails in production.

**Prompt stuffing** — dump all tool schemas into the system prompt and let the model pick. Works until you have 30 tools. Then the context window fills up, latency spikes, and accuracy drops.

**Hand-crafted routing tables** — explicit `{ "search for code": searchCode }` maps. Requires continuous maintenance. Breaks on any variation in LLM output phrasing.

**Agent loops** — let the model pick tools autonomously on every call. Expensive. Unpredictable latency. Hard to cache.

## The solution: semantic dispatch

smallchat treats tool routing as a **message dispatch problem**, borrowing the solution from the Objective-C runtime.

The insight is simple: tool intent and tool description exist in the same semantic space. If you embed tool descriptions at compile time, embed each intent at runtime and compare them by cosine similarity, you get routing that:

- Handles paraphrases: `"search for code"` and `"find code in a repo"` resolve to the same tool
- Caches hot paths: repeat dispatches skip the embedding entirely
- Fails closed: below the confidence the dispatch policy requires, nothing runs and the result lists the candidates
- Stays fast: the hot path is a cache lookup + hash table walk

## The Obj-C runtime inspiration

Alan Kay's key insight — "the big idea is messaging" — applies directly to LLM tool use. In Objective-C:

- Objects respond to selectors (method names)
- `objc_msgSend` looks up the selector in a dispatch table, walks the class hierarchy if needed, and invokes the implementation
- An inline cache avoids the lookup on repeat calls
- If nothing responds, `forwardInvocation:` provides a fallback

smallchat maps this model directly:

- ToolProviders respond to ToolSelectors (semantic fingerprints)
- `toolkit_dispatch` looks up the selector in the SelectorTable, walks the ToolClass hierarchy, and invokes the ToolIMP
- The ResolutionCache avoids the embedding on repeat dispatches
- If no tool is chosen with enough confidence, nothing runs: the result says why and lists the candidates to call by id

The mapping is not metaphorical — the implementation structure mirrors the Obj-C runtime deliberately.

## Primitives, not a framework

Most LLM frameworks are opinionated end-to-end systems. They own your agent loop, your memory, your prompts. smallchat is different: it provides one well-defined primitive — the dispatch layer — and gets out of the way.

You decide how to call tools. You decide what to do with the results. You compose with the language itself.

```typescript
// That's it. One call. You own everything else.
const result = await runtime.dispatch('search for code', args);
```

## Comparison

| Concern | LangChain | smallchat |
|---|---|---|
| Streaming | `CallbackManager` + custom piping | `for await` over native provider deltas |
| Tool dispatch | Chain/Agent hierarchy | One `smallchat_dispatchStream` call |
| Caching | External wrappers | Built-in resolution cache |
| Extensibility | Subclass and register | `toolClass.addMethod` or swizzle |
| Runs where | Framework runtime | In your process: embedding and resolution need no network or LLM API |
| Architecture | Framework owns your loop | You own your loop |

## No external services

Embedding runs in-process with the bundled ONNX model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), so resolving an intent needs no network or LLM API. `@smallchat/core` does have runtime dependencies — the MCP SDK, Ajv, ONNX Runtime, SQLite (`better-sqlite3`, `sqlite-vec`) and `@shorthand/core` — and tools run on their own servers (MCP, REST, local handlers).

## MCP native

`smallchat serve` is an MCP server built on the official SDK, which negotiates the protocol version with each client (2025-11-25 down to 2024-10-07). It serves stdio by default, or Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` with `--http` and a bearer token, and forwards each `tools/call`, by exact name, to the upstream server that owns the tool.

```bash
# Your tools, available to any MCP client, in one command
npx -y @smallchat/core@^1 serve --source tools.toolkit.json
```
